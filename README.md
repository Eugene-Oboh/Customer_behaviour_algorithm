# Customer_behaviour_algorithm
This Repository contains files for a machine learning algorithm which predicts if a customer will buy again from an audio book company.
The Jupyter notebook files contains the model algorithm which are well commented
You only need the 'Audiobook_data.csv', Data preproprocessing.ipnb and Model algirithm.ipynb files to run the model
Your environment should contain Tensor flow, numpy and sklearn. 
start from the Data preprocessing.ipynb file, which will created 3 additional files.
Then you run the Model algorithm.ipynb file to execute the algorithm.
